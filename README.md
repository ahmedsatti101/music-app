# Music app

## About
This is a personal project that aims to work similar to Spotify and Apple Music in which it allows the user to listen to music, create playlists and download the music they enjoy for offline listening. This project marks my learning journey with Dart, a object-oritented programming language with similar syntax to `C`, and using Flutter, a UI SDK developed by `Google` that allows writing a single codebase for `Android`, `iOS`, `Linux`, `macOS`, `Windows` and the `Web`.
