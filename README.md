# Music app (work in progress)

## About
This is a personal project that aims to work similar to Spotify and Apple Music in which it allows the user to listen to music, create playlists and download the music they enjoy for offline listening. This project marks my learning journey in mobile development using `Dart`, a object-oritented programming language with similar syntax to `C`, and using `Flutter`, a UI SDK developed by `Google` that allows writing a single codebase for `Android`, `iOS`, `Linux`, `macOS`, `Windows` and the `Web`.

## Run the app
Clone the repo to your machine by clicking on the green Code button above then copy the URL and navigate to a directory where you want to clone the repo using your terminal then type `git clone repo-url-here` and press `Enter`. Once that is done you will need to download the `Flutter` SDK in order to run and use the app. You can follow the instructions in the `Flutter` [docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install it. When prompted to choose the type of your app select `Android`.
